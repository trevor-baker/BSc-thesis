## BSc Honours thesis 
Completed in 2012 with Dr. Andy Black of UBC's [Biometeorology and Soil Physics Research Group](https://biomet.landfood.ubc.ca/)

My research was on the effects of biochar application on soil water-holding capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, which was related to [a wider research project](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0345623) being done near Campbell River on Vancouver Island.
