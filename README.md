## My BSc Honours thesis 
Completed in 2012 with Dr. Andy Black of UBC's [Biometeorology and Soil Physics Research Group](https://biomet.landfood.ubc.ca/)

My topic was the effects of biochar application on soil water-holding capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, which was related to research being done near Campbell River on Vancouver Island.
